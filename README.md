PlaceholderSupport
================
Fallback for browsers that do not support the placeholder property.

How to use
----------
Just add the PlaceholderSupport.js to your website.

    #JS
    new PlaceholderSupport();

    or

    new PlaceholderSupport(elements);

Leave "elements" empty to add placeholder functionality to all inputs and textarea elements with a "placeholder" attribute.

"elements" can be empty, a string with CSS selectors, or an array with elements.
